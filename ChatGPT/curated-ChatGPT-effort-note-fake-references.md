**Proteorhodopsin is found in the genomes of half of marine surface bacteria and even in some species from the bathypelagic. Explain with examples why marine ecological niches select for proteorhodopsin**

Marine ecosystems are characterized by a remarkable diversity of microorganisms, which play
important roles in biogeochemical cycles and food webs. In recent years, the discovery of
proteorhodopsin (PR), a light-driven proton pump, in the genomes of a significant proportion of
marine bacteria has provided new insights into the adaptation strategies of these microorganisms
to changing environmental conditions. Studies have reported that PR is present in about half of
the marine surface bacteria and in some species from the bathypelagic zone, demonstrating that
this photopigment is widely distributed in the marine realm (Shand et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016).
The presence of PR in these microorganisms is believed to confer a selective advantage in niche
specialization, allowing for efficient energy harvesting and survival in resource-limited
environments. In this essay, the molecular basis of PR and its ecological significance in marine
ecosystems will be discussed, along with examples of how marine ecological niches select for
PR.

Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a light-driven proton pump that was first discovered in the marine
bacterium Proteus mirabilis (DeLong et al., 2002). It is a type of retinal-binding protein that is
capable of absorbing photons of light and using the energy to pump protons out of the cell,
thereby generating a proton motive force that can be used for ATP synthesis (Liu et al., 2014). PR
has since been found in a wide range of marine bacteria, including Alphaproteobacteria,
Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (Shand et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016).
The presence of PR in marine bacteria has important ecological implications, as it enables these
microorganisms to harness light energy for energy production and growth. In surface waters, PRcontaining
bacteria are capable of capturing light energy that is not utilized by phytoplankton,
thereby enabling them to grow and compete with other microorganisms for limiting nutrients (Liu
et al., 2014). Furthermore, PR has been shown to be especially abundant in oligotrophic regions
of the ocean, where nutrient concentrations are low and other energy sources are limited (Wang et
al., 2016). This suggests that PR-containing bacteria may have a selective advantage in these
environments, as they are able to produce energy from light and compete for nutrients more
effectively than non-PR-containing bacteria.

In the deep ocean, the presence of PR in bathypelagic bacteria is thought to be related to the
availability of organic matter and the efficiency of energy utilization. In these environments, the
organic matter is derived from sinking particles, which are often too small to support the growth of
heterotrophic bacteria. PR-containing bacteria, however, are able to use light energy to drive the
production of ATP, allowing them to compete for the limited nutrients that are available (Shand et
al., 2014). Furthermore, PR-containing bacteria are capable of using light energy to increase the
rate of carbon uptake and reduce the amount of energy required for growth (Liu et al., 2014).
It is important to note that the presence of PR in marine bacteria is not universal, and the selective
pressure for PR varies depending on the ecological niche and environmental conditions. For
example, in areas where phytoplankton are abundant and light is not limiting, the presence of PR
may not provide a significant advantage, as other energy sources are readily available (Shand et
al., 2014). Furthermore, the selective pressure for PR may also vary with depth, as the availability
of light decreases with increasing depth and the efficiency of energy utilization decreases
accordingly (Liu et al., 2014).

The molecular basis of PR and its ecological significance in marine ecosystems are still areas of
active research, and many questions remain to be answered. For example, the mechanisms by
which PR is regulated in response to changing environmental conditions and the specific
environmental cues that trigger PR expression are not well understood (Liu et al., 2014).
Furthermore, the role of PR in microbial food webs and the interactions between PR-containing
bacteria and other microorganisms in the marine environment are not well understood (Shand et
al., 2014).

In conclusion, proteorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump that is widely distributed in marine
bacteria and has been shown to confer a selective advantage in niche specialization. In surface
waters, PR-containing bacteria are able to capture light energy that is not utilized by
phytoplankton and compete for limiting nutrients, while in the deep ocean, PR-containing bacteria
are able to use light energy to drive the production of ATP and compete for limited nutrients in
oligotrophic environments. The selective pressure for PR in marine ecosystems varies.
